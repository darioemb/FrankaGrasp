is calculating grasp points and approach vectors from a point cloud.
In a first step the point cloud is read from a ROS topic and a heightsgrid is created.
For each 14x14 square of the hightsgrid a featurevector is created. 
Using SVM with an existing model file, it is predicted if the center of the square is a good 
grasping point. For good grasping points the coordinates and the direction of the approach vectors
are published.
 

== Input == 

A point cloud from objects [inside a box]
(points of box are eliminated)


== Output ==

Grasp points and approach vectors which are detected using Support Vector Machines
(at the beginning the approach vectors are parallel to the z-axis) 



== LIBSVM ==

We have included LIBSVM to work as our classifier:
